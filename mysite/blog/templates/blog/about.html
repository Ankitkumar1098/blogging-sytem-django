        A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
        Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. 
        Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic.
        <br><br>

        The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming.
        Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts.

        Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports. Others function as more personal online diaries, and others function more as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company.
        A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs.
